# portfolio-website
Simplistic portfolio website inspired by the old school systems such as Windows XP and Windows 7. I wanted to go for a more creative approach when designing my portfolio website, but at the same time keeping it user friendly. The nostalgia of old Windows systems makes this project a joy to work on.
