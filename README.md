# portfolio-website
Simplistic portfolio website inspired by the old school systems such as Windows XP and Windows 7. I wanted to go for a more creative approach when designing my portfolio website, but at the same time keeping it user friendly. The nostalgia of old Windows systems makes this project a joy to work on.


#Desktop Inspired Portfolio Website

As a beginning to my projects, I wanted to start with a platform to have somewhere to display them on first. Looking at a few examples online, I knew I wanted something simple, but also more creative and fun at the same time. My main goal is to keep it interesting without sacrificing easy navigation. To achieve this, I want to bring a simplified desktop experience to this project and while doing so, I want to adjust to the reflexes and instincts users have when navigating their own desktop.
